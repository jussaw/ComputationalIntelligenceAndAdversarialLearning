The question that lingered all off season was "Who would be the starter against Louisville?" We got our answer as Tua Tagovailoa trotted out to lead the Crimson Tide to a 51 -14 victory over the Cardinals. We'll leave the talk about who should be the permanent started to you but throughout the night both quarterbacks saw playing time while the only thing Louisville players saw where the backs of Bama's helmets. The game was never in doubt as Tua helped lead the offense by throwing for 227 yards, rushing for 26, and totaling 3 touchdowns on the night. On the night Jalen Hurts finished with 70 yards passing, 9 yards rushing , and no touchdowns. 

Four running backs saw significant action with Damien Harris leading the charge. Harris finished with 7 carries for 55 yards, Josh Jacobs had 6 carries for 45 yards with a touchdown, Brian Robinson Jr. ran 7 times for 42 yards, and Najee Harris got 8 carries for 30 yards plus a touchdown.

The man who pulled in the National Championship winning catch last year, Devonta Smith, was the favorite target through the air on Saturday night. Smith caught 4 passes for 99 yards, Jaylen Waddle chipped in 3 catches for 66 yards, Jerry Jeudy had 4 catches for 64 with two of the receptions being touchdowns, and Irv Smith Jr. caught two passes for 39 yards.

Overall, Alabama had 519 total yards of offense while Louisville only had 268 yards of total offense. Bama's defense held the Cardinals to only 16 yards rushing.
