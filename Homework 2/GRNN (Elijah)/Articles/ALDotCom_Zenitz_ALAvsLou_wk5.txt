Vegas oddsmakers don't expect Billy Napier and the Louisiana Rajin' Cajuns to put up much of a fight against Alabama this week.
The Crimson Tide is a 49-point favorite, according to Vegas Insider.
Napier, a former Alabama wide receivers coach, is in his first year as the head coach at Louisiana.
The team has dropped its last two games after a season-opening win over Grambling State.
Louisiana lost, 56-10, to Mississippi State Sept. 15 and then fell on Saturday to Coastal Carolina, a team that was in the FCS as recently as 2016.
