#1 Alabama hit the road to face 1-4 Arkansas and we knew what was going to happen before the ball was even kicked off. The Tide's third offensive play summarized their whole season to date; even when something goes wrong, they score a touchdown. Irv Smith took his first catch to the house on the first play from scrimmage, on this third offensive play it looked like another touchdown until Irv fumbled at the 10 yard line before Henry Ruggs scooped it up to make it 14 - 0 in the blink of any eye. Things never got better for the Razorbacks.

Tua Tagovailoa was deadly again throwing for 334 yards on 10 of 13 with 4 touchdowns. Damien Harris lead the charge on the ground with 111 yards and 2 touchdowns. Jerry Jeudy caught 4 passes for 135 yards and 2 touchdowns. Irv Smith had 2 catches for 123 yards and a touchdown.

The 6-0 Tide now get to host Missouri in Bryant-Denny Stadium this weekend. Barring the first string offense and defense getting suspended for the game, expect another lopsided win for Bama.
