The Tide rolled into Oxford and rolled out with an easy win to open SEC play. Ole Miss scored on their first offensive play of the game but that would be their only highlight as Bama showed why they're #1.
Saban continued to rotate his quarterbacks as Tua Tagovailoa went 11/15 for 191 yards, rushed for 47 yards, and scored 2 touchdowns. Jalen Hurts threw for 85 yards on 10 attempts scoring 2 touchdowns and throwing 1 interception. Jerry Jeudy was the favorite target through the air as he caught 3 passes for 136 yards and two touchdowns. Damien Harris led the ground game with 62 yards rushing and a touchdown.
Alabama now turns it's attention to #22 Texas A&M in Bryant-Denny this weekend. The Aggies took #2 Clemson down to the wire a few weeks ago so it should be a much tougher test than Ole Miss. Catch #1 Alabama vs. #22 Texas A&M this Saturday at 2:30pm on CBS
