Why do teams insist on scheduling Alabama to open the year?

Why would you willingly give Nick Saban a full offseason to gameplan for you?

Haven’t you noticed by now that it’s not a winnable situation? Look at the last few years!

This year’s victim in the Alabama Crimson Tide season-opening bludgeoning were the Louisville Cardinals. Alabama made Louisville travel all the way to Orlando, only to beat them, 51-14.

Unsurprisingly, the game was never close. Alabama scored on three of its first four drives, and took a 28-0 lead into the locker room at halftime.

Tua Tagovailoa got the bulk of the work at quarterback, going 12-16 for 226 yards and two touchdowns. He also added a rushing touchdown, as did Josh Jacobs and Najee Harris. The Tide outgained the Cardinals, 519-268.

Alabama’s defense combined for 11 tackles for loss in the dominating victory.

Louisville quarterback Jawon Pass struggled, going 20-39 for 252 yards, and a pair of touchdowns and interceptions.

The Crimson Tide will host Arkansas State next week and improve to 2-0.
