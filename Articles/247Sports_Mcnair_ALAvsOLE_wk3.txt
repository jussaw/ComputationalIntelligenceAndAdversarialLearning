Figures can lie and liars can figure, goes the adage. Football coaches pay attention to statistics – some of them more than others. Those numbers likely become more relevant as the season progresses, but even a two-game sample can give an indication of what to expect.
One doesn’t have to delve too deeply into this week’s statistical comparison to suspect that Alabama’s game at Ole Miss Saturday evening could be a high-scoring affair; and, perhaps, quite a long game. Kickoff is at 6 p.m. CDT in Vaught-Hemingway Stadium (64,038) with ESPN televising.
Both teams have 2-0 records approaching this Southeastern Conference opener for both teams. No. 1-ranked Alabama has defeated Louisville, 51-14, and Arkansas State, 57-7, while Mississippi has wins over Texas Tech, 47-27, and Southern Illinois, 76-41.
One doesn’t need a calculator to see that both offenses are putting up points.
Because the scoreboard is ultimately what matters, the first statistical comparison of the teams is in scoring and scoring defense. Ole Miss leads the SEC in scoring at 61.5 points per game, while Alabama is second at 54 ppg.
But there’s another side to that scoring objective, which is stopping the opponent. Alabama is not in its usual position of first in the SEC, but the Crimson Tide is only a few points behind the leader in giving up 10.5 points per game and ranking fifth in the conference. The Rebels, though, have given up 68 points — 34 per game — and that is last among the 14 conference teams.
The Tide is sixth in the SEC in rushing offense at 250 yards per game, while Ole Miss is eighth at 188.5 ypg. The Rebels, however, are averaging 6.3 yards per rushing attempt to only 5.8 for Bama. On defense, Alabama is only eighth in the conference in rushing performance, giving up 94.5 ypg, and the Rebels are 13th, giving up 202.5 ypg.
Ole Miss is leading the league (and is second in the nation) in pass offense, throwing it for 407.5 yards per game. Bama is fourth in the league, 309 per game. The Tide is first in passing efficiency, Mississippi second. Defensively, Alabama is an unTidelike 10th, giving up 235 ypg, but that looks good next to the Rebels, last in the league allowing 355 ypg. In pass defense efficiency, Alabama is second, Mississippi 10th.
Ole Miss is second in the league in total offense, 596 yards per game, while Bama is fifth at 559. In total defense, Alabama is eighth, allowing 329.5, the Rebels last, giving up 557.5.
There are three areas considered by a majority of teams to be most important statistically — third-down efficiency, turnover margin, and Red Zone (inside the 20-yard line) performance.
The 45 percent mark is the benchmark in third-down success. Alabama leads the SEC in third-down performance having succeeded 20 times in 30 opportunities for 66.7 percent. Ole Miss is 10-23 for 43.5 percent. Defensively, Bama is fourth in the league, surrendering 8 successes in 33 opportunities for 24.2 percent. The Rebels are 12th on third down defense, opponents 15-36 for 41.7 percent.
The Rebels are plus 2 in turnover margin with 1 fumble recovery and 2 interceptions and having given up 1 fumble. The Tide is plus 1 in turnover margin, three interceptions gained, two fumbles lost.
Ole Miss has been perfect on nine trips inside the Red Zone (5 touchdowns, 4-4 field goals), while Alabama has scored on 8-10 trips, all 8 successes TDs, the failures a fumble and a missed field goal. On defense, Bama has allowed only 2 scores, both TDs, in five trips for 40 percent. The Rebels have allowed 11-14 (7 TDs, 4-4 field goals) for a 78.6 rate.
In the kicking game, Alabama ranks ahead of Ole Miss in kickoff returns, punt returns, and punting, and the Rebels are better in kickoff coverage and field goals. With three missed extra points, the Tide is dead last in PAT execution, while the Rebels are next-to-last because they’ve missed one extra point kick.
Sacks are only one part of “affecting the passer,” which is Alabama Coach Nick Saban’s mantra, but we’ve noticed sacks are quite a decisive effect. The Tide ranks fifth in the league in sacks, 5 for 22 yards, and Ole Miss is tied for 12th with 1 for 4 yards. Bama has suffered 2 sacks for 13 yards, the Rebels 3-22.
Alabama is 11th in the SEC in penalties, the Tide flagged 14 times for 146 yards, while Ole Miss is sixth in the league with 16-124. In what is exactly opposite of the usual, Bama opponents are penalized the most, 21 times for 177 yards. Rebels opponents have been flagged 14 times for 128 yards.
Sometimes, time of possession is an important statistic and sometimes it is completely irrelevant, and the problem is one doesn’t know its measure until after the game. Still, it is interesting that Alabama is averaging keeping the ball 31:26 out of the 60 minutes of game time, while Ole Miss is a distant last in the league at only 22:05.
The Rebels have a number of individuals leading in SEC stats, notably quarterback Jordan Ta’amu leading in passing at 392 yards per game and total offense at 394.5 per game. The Rebels’ A.J. Brown leads in receptions per game (7.5) and placekicker Luke Logan is best at 12.5 points per game.
Alabama’s Tua Tagovailoa leads the league in passing efficiency with Ole Miss’ Jordan second.
