When Tua Tagovailoa stepped out onto the field in Orlando to start the game at quarterback for Alabama against Louisville, it was more a matter of satisfying the curiosity of Crimson Tide fans than being a big surprise. Tagovailoa was clearly the best Saturday night in Orlando in leading Bama to a 51-14 win over the Cardinals.
Alabama has now won 12 consecutive season-opening games under Coach Nick Saban. The Tide has outscored the opposition by 486-141 in those 12 games, an average score of 40.5-11.8.
This is the 124th year Alabama has fielded a football team and the Crimson Tide’s Saturday night victory was the 100th season-opener in storied Bama history. The record in those games to open the season is 100-21-3.
Alabama came into the game ranked first in the nation and Louisville was not ranked a year after having lost Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Lamar Jackson. Bama’s win was its national record 74th in a row over unranked teams.
Bama improved its record to 87-49-4 in neutral site games, including a 20-5 record under Saban.
As Saban begins his 12th season in Tuscaloosa, he has amassed a record of 133-20, a winning percentage of .869.
The Tide has won three of four games against Louisville in history.
Cardinals Coach Bobby Petrino is now 0-5 against Alabama, his first four games coming when he was head coach at Arkansas.
Here are other notes from the Crimson Tide’s win:
Alabama will have its Bryant-Denny Stadium debut next weekend hosting Arkansas State at 2:30 p.m. CDT Saturday. ESPN2 will televise the game.
Alabama starting the season with a new quarterback is hardly anything new. Beginning with AJ McCarron in 2013, Bama has had a new starter in the first game in six straight seasons – McCarron followed by Blake Sims in 2014, Jake Coker in 2015, Blake Barnett in 2016, Jalen Hurts in 2017, and Tua Tagovailoa in 2018.
The Tide had 11 players make their first career starts vs. Louisville -- four on offense, four on defense and three specialists. Getting their first career starts on offense were offensive lineman Alex Leatherwood, wide receivers Henry Ruggs III and DeVonta Smith, and quarterback Tagovailoa. Making their first starts on defense were lineman Quinnen Williams and defensive backs Saivion Smith, Xavier McKinney, and Shyheim Carter. Placekickers Austin Jones and Joseph Bulovas and punter Skyler DeLong started for the first time on special teams.
Deionte Thompson’s second quarter interception gave Alabama at least one forced turnover in 43 of its last 45 games dating to the start of the 2015 season. Later Shyheim Carter had an interception which he returned for Bama’s final touchdown. During the current run, the Crimson Tide has forced 75 turnovers (52 interceptions, 23 fumbles) and returned 18 of those miscues for touchdowns.
NOTs – non-offensive touchdowns – have been important to Alabama success in recent years. Carter’s 25-yard interception return score against Louisville and Josh Jacobs’s 77-yard kickoff return for a TD gives the Tide 63 in Saban’s career – 28 interceptions, 9 fumble recoveries/returns, 5 kickoff returns, 16 punt returns, and 5 blocked punts returned.
Bama just missed on another as freshman Jaylen Waddle returned a punt for a touchdown, only to have it wiped out by a penalty – one of 10 flags for 110 yards in penalties
Alabama had a 28-0 lead against Louisville at intermission, and the Tide now has a 118-7 record under Saban when leading at halftime. The Tide has held the lead in 36 of its last 45 games.
