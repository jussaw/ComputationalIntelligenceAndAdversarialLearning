It begins with Tua…literally. Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa’s 76-yard touchdown pass to Irv Smith Jr., on Bama’s first play from scrimmage in Alabama’s 65-31 win over Arkansas in Fayetteville was the Crimson Tide’s sixth-straight opening drive touchdown this season. Alabama has now won 21-straight games when scoring a touchdown on its first offensive possession of a game. The Tide’s last loss after finding the end zone on its first drive was to Oklahoma in the 2014 Allstate Sugar Bowl.

Here are notes from the win by Bama, now 6-0 overall and 3-0 in Southeastern Conference games.

The game-opening Tide TD marks the second consecutive game against the Razorbacks that Alabama has scored on its first offensive snap. Running back Damien Harris opened the 2017 game at Bryant-Denny Stadium with a 75-yard touchdown run.

Tagovailoa was quarterback on eight series against the Hogs – one of which he split time with Jalen Hurts and not including a 30-second run-out-the-clock end of first half series -- and the Tide scored touchdowns on seven of them. He played only one series in the second half.

Tagovailoa has directed 44 drives as the Tide’s starting quarterback this season with 31 resulting touchdowns and two ending in field goals. In those 44 drives, the Tide offense is 21-of-31 on third down conversions and has accounted for 2,144 yards on 219 snaps for an average of 9.8 yards per play and 220 of the 302 points scored by the UA offense.

In Bama’s last two games,Tagovailoa is 18 for 20 with 462 yards passing and six touchdowns in the first half against Louisiana and Arkansas for a passing efficiency rating of 383.04.

In three games against Southeastern Conference opponents this season, Tagovailoa has thrown for 912 yards and 10 touchdowns on 43-of-58 passing (.741) and an efficiency rating of 263.12.

Tagovailoa’s 334 passing yards and four touchdown passes marks the first time a Power 5 QB has thrown for 300 or more yards and four scores in the first half of a conference game since Patrick Mahomes vs. Baylor on Nov. 25, 2016.

It was mostly about the Alabama offense in Fayetteville. For the second consecutive game the Tide did not call on punter Sky DeLong.

Alabama’s 639 yards in total offense marks the sixth time the Crimson Tide has topped 500 yards this season and the 18th time in the last 50 games dating to the start of the 2015 campaign. This is Alabama’s first six-game run of 500-yard total offense performances in program history.

It was also the second consecutive game the Tide has cracked the 600-yard total offense mark. The 639 yard total Saturday is the eighth best in school history, and the 13th time Bama has achieved the 600-yard plateau in the Nick Saban Era. It is Bama’s fourth best output under Saban.

The 65 points gives Alabama 45 or more points in all six games this year, another first in Crimson Tide history. The results this year: Alabama 51-14 over Louisville, 57-7 over Arkansas State, 61-7 over Ole Miss, 45-23 over Texas A&M, 56-14 over Louisiana, and 65-31 over Arkansas.

Previous best was four consecutive games by the 1945 Tide (Kentucky, 60-19; Vanderbilt, 71-0; Pensacola Naval Air Station, 55-6; and Mississippi State, 55-13).

It wasn’t all about Tagovailoa. With 111 yards rushing, senior Damien Harris has 2,555 yards on the ground for his career, moving him into 11th place on the UA career rushing chart. Harris has now run for 236 yards against Arkansas in the Tide’s last two meetings with the Razorbacks. Today’s performance is the Richmond, Ky., native’s eighth 100-yard rushing game of his career and his first since rushing for 125 in the Tide’s 2017 meeting with the Hogs.

With the career-high 123 receiving yards from tight end Irv Smith Jr., and 135 yards from sophomore wide receiver Jerry Jeudy, Alabama had two players with more than 100 yards receiving in a single game for just the seventh time in school history and the second time in two games. Freshman Jaylen Waddle (138) and sophomore Henry Ruggs III (116) both topped the century mark against Louisiana a week ago.

With three first-half scoring drives of 21, 50 and 12 seconds, 15 of the Crimson Tide’s scoring drives this season have lasted less than a minute with seven lasting less than 30 seconds. Alabama led the nation in scoring drives under a minute with 12 in its first five games.

Alabama games have been mostly over by intermission. The Tide is outscoring its opponents, 238-34 (39.7-5.7), in the first half. That total includes a 124-21 (20.7-3.5) first quarter advantage and a 114-13 (19.0-2.2) difference in the second quarter.

Against Arkansas, Alabama had a 41-14 halftime lead and had amassed 463 yards of total offense. The Tide is averaging 375.6 yards in total offense in the first half this season. The Tide has racked up 340 or more total yards in the first half in five of six games -- 340 vs. Louisville, 395 vs. Arkansas State, 418 at Ole Miss, and 357 vs. Louisiana prior to the Arkansas game.

The highlights of the defense were forcing three turnovers and adding anther NOT – non-offensive touchdown.

Bama had two fumble recoveries and an interception and now has delivered at least one takeaway in 48 of its last 50 games dating to the start of the 2015 season. During that run, the Tide has forced 85 turnovers (58 interceptions, 27 fumbles) and returned 20 of those takeaways for TDs.

Junior defensive back Shyheim Carter’s fourth quarter 44-yard interception return for a touchdown against the Razorbacks is Alabama’s 67th non-offensive touchdown of the Nick Saban era and its sixth this season. The score was also the fourth pick-six for the Tide and the second for Carter in 2018.

Alabama has scored 80 points off 13 opponent giveaways this season, scoring on 12 of the turnovers and intercepting a pass to end the first half against Louisiana on Sept. 29. The Tide defense has directly accounted for 28 points on three interception returns, while the offense has posted 52 points on its eight post-turnover possessions.

The win was No. 1 Alabama’s 78th in a row over an unranked team, which is a record in major college football.

Saban’s Bama teams have defeated Arkansas in all 12 meetings and on the field the Tide has an all-time record of 22-7 against the Razorbacks (19-8 after NCAA-mandated forfeit and vacancies).

Tide left tackle Jonah Williams, who had been characterized as “a little bit of a question” by Saban after suffering a sprained ankle last week was able to start the game and play.

Captains were running back Damien Harris, linebacker Anfernee Jennings, and center Ross Pierschbacher.
