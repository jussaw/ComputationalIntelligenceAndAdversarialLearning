We had already gone back and checked on their results – having remembered their prediction of the Kentucky upset of Mississippi State – so we knew what to expect when we got the report from the Almost Perfect Picks Department. There obviously was some hesitation on the part of the Nerds because all was quiet down the hall outside their compound – the war room and break room.
Eventually, though, we noticed some shuffling and saw the Grand Geek coming our way. His smile looked a bit forced.
“Nailed them all again,” he said, handing over the results. And then he began to turn with a “Back to work now” wave.
We stopped him with congratulations on him and his cohorts being correct on all eight games picked, and particularly on predicting the Kentucky upset. We put on our most innocent expression in asking how the other parts of the predictions had gone in Week 4.
“We were about like Alabama,” he said. “We were just okay, a little out of sync. And there were a couple of other teams who let us down.” 
We said we hoped no one had been bruised by depending on their predicted scores. 
“Please don’t mention that around the boys,” the Geek said. “They are very sensitive.” 
Other than the perfect 8-0 on selecting winners, the sensitive boys struggled to a 4-4 mark against the betting line and 3-5 on the over-under (combined points to be scored by both teams).
For the year, the Nerds are 39-6 in predicting the winning team, 23-11 against the spread, and 16-17 on the over-under.
