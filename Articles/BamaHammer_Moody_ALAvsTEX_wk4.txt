Alabama football enters the game fresh off of three blowout victories. Texas A&M is the Crimson Tide’s first ranked opponent. However, it is fake news as they come into Bryant Denny ranked 22nd in the nation. The Aggies are not who we thought they were. Playing Clemson late into the fourth quarter has given $75 million coach Jimbo Fisher false hope heading into Tuscaloosa.
The nation has not even seen the best of the Crimson Tide. Neither coordinator has had to dive deep into their playbooks. Do not expect it to begin this weekend.
The first bold prediction for the Alabama football/Texas A&M matchup starts with the Crimson Tide’s star receiver.
Jerry Jeudy scores three touchdowns
Sophomore wide receiver Jerry Jeudy has caught eleven receptions this season. Six for touchdowns. Not just a one-yard catch, either.
Jeudy has hauled in two scores in each game this season. His three longest catches are for 79, 58 and 25 yards. Against Ole Miss, he averaged 45.3 yards per reception.
Last year, Henry Ruggs III led the team with six touchdown catches. Jeudy tied him in three games.
