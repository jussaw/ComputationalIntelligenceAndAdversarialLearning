Say, Buddy, have you got a minute? A minute – actually less than a minute – has become a dynamic in Alabama football this year, and that was the case again Saturday in Bryant-Denny Stadium as the No. 1 ranked Crimson Tide ran its record to 5-0 with a 56-14 over the Louisiana Ragin’ Cajuns.

Alabama’s 55-second scoring drive in the first quarter and 33-second, one-play drive in the third quarter against Louisiana were the Crimson Tide’s  NCAA-leading 12th and 13th scoring drives of less than a minute this season.

Here are notes from Bama’s Saturday action:

The first of the lightning strikes came following a Derek Kief punt block that set the Bama up at Louisiana’s 14-yard line. On a second-and-9, Bama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threaded a pass into the hands of Henry Ruggs III for the TD. Elapsed time of the “drive” was 55 seconds.

Alabama’s only score of the second half came with the Tide’s third quarterback, Mac Jones, at the helm. Jones went into the game with just under two minutes remaining in the third quarter and Bama backed up. After a first down penalty, it was first-and-15 from the Alabama 6. Jones hit freshman wide receiver Jaylen Waddle over the middle, and Waddle took it on a 94-yard touchdown that made it 56-0. Elapsed time was 33 seconds.

Technically, Alabama had one other TD success in under a minute, and again it was the electric Waddle. Louisiana punted to the Tide freshman who gathered it in at the Alabama 37, avoided the initial rush, and then got outside and down the sideline before cutting back inside and finishing the 63-yard touchdown play.

Waddle recorded his first career punt return touchdown and first two career touchdown receptions (he also had a 20-yard TD catch from Tagovailoa) and Jones threw his first touchdown pass.

Alabama had opened the game with a nine-yard scoring run by Josh Jacobs on the Tide’s initial possession of the game. It was Bama’s fifth straight opening drive touchdown this season. Alabama has now won 20 consecutive games when scoring a touchdown on its first offensive possession of a game. The Tide’s last loss after scoring a TD on its first possession was to Oklahoma in the 2014 Sugar Bowl.

Through five games this season, Alabama is outscoring its opponents, 197-20 (39.4-4.0), in the first half -- a 103-14 first quarters advantage and a 94-6 difference in second quarters.

Under head coach Nick Saban, the Crimson Tide is 122-7 (.946) when leading at the half. The Tide led Louisiana, 49-0, at intermission. Alabama has held the lead at the half in 39 of its last 49 games dating back to the start of the 2015 season. Alabama is also 106-4 (.964) when leading by seven or more points at the break during the Saban era.

Alabama has now won 22-consecutive games at Bryant-Denny Stadium, the second-longest home winning streak in school history. The Crimson Tide won 24 in a row at home (Bryant-Denny and Legion Field combined) from Sept. 18, 1971 to Nov 9, 1974.

Alabama’s two interceptions Saturday gives the Crimson Tide at least one forced turnover in 47 of its last 49 games dating back to the start of the 2015 season. During the current run, the Crimson Tide has forced 82 turnovers (58 interceptions, 24 fumbles) and returned 19 of those miscues for touchdowns.

The Tide has scored 59 points off of 10 opponent giveaways this season and has scored on nine of the opposition miscues with the 10th turnover coming on an interception at the end of the first half against Louisiana. Defensively, Alabama has not allowed a point following any of its four miscues. The Tide defense has directly accounted for 21 points on three interception returns, while the offense has posted 38 points on its five post-turnover possessions.

Alabama’s 608 yards in total offense against Louisiana marks the fifth time the Crimson Tide has topped 500 yards this season and the 17th time in the last 49 games dating to the start of the 2015 season. This is Alabama’s first five-game run of 500-yard total offense performances in program history. This was also Alabama’s first 600-yard game since rolling up 604 yards against Tennessee in 2017.

Alabama has scored 45 or more points in five-consecutive games for the first time in school history. The 1945 Crimson Tide hit the 45-point mark four times (Kentucky, 60-19; Vanderbilt, 71-0; Pensacola N.A.S, 55-6; Mississippi State, 55-13). Bama has averaged scoring 55.4 points in its first five games.

Tagovailoa has directed 35 drives as the Tide’s starting quarterback with 24 resulting in touchdowns and two in field goals. In those drives, the Tide offense is 17-for-21 on third down conversions, accounting for 1,692 yards on 185 snaps for an average of 9.1 yards per play and 172 of the 244 points scored by the UA offense.

In Alabama’s four possessions against Louisiana with Tua Tagovailoa at quarterback, the Crimson Tide was 2-for-2 on third down conversions with Tagovailoa converting one attempt with a two-yard run on the Tide’s opening drive and throwing a 20-yard touchdown pass to Jaylen Waddle on third-and-eight on UA’s final scoring drive of the first half. The sophomore signal caller is 18-for-21 passing on third down in 2018 for 392 yards and seven touchdowns. He has also carried the ball five times on third down for 38 yards and five first downs.

Tagovailoa was 8-8 passing for 128 yards and 2 TDs Saturday. He came into the game leading the nation in passing efficiency.

Perhaps the biggest non-scoring cheer of the day came when Jalen Hurts entered the game at quarterback for Alabama in the final minute of the first quarter, establishing Hurts’s intention to be a part of the Crimson Tide at least through this season, thousands of inside source reports having stated otherwise. Hurts completed 4-6 passes for 118 yards and one touchdown, a 54-yard connection with Henry Ruggs III.

Senior Derek Kief’s blocked punt against Louisiana was the first for the Crimson Tide since Damien Harris’ block against Florida State on Sept. 2, 2017 in Atlanta. Waddle’s 63-yard punt return on Louisiana’s next punt was the first punt return for a score since Eddie Jackson went 79 yards at Tennessee on Oct. 15, 2016.

Waddle’s return was Alabama’s 66th non-offensive touchdown of the Saban Era, and the Tide’s fifth this season (3 interceptions, 1 punt return, 1 kickoff return).

Nick Saban got off the “unlucky 13” number. A week ago when Alabama defeated Texas A&M and Jimbo Fisher, 45-23, it marked the 13th time and 13th victory for Saban head coaching against one of his former assistant coaches. Saturday the Tide defeated Louisiana, coached by former Saban assistant Billy Napier. All of the Saban vs. pupul games have come in his years at Bama.

Alabama is now 9-0 all-time against Louisiana – once known a Southwestern Louisiana and also as Louisiana-Lafayette.

Honorary captains were former Alabama linebacker Mike Hall and former Tide defensive back Bobby Johns.

Team captains were safety Dieonte Thompson, linebacker Christian Miller, and offensive lineman Josh Casher.
