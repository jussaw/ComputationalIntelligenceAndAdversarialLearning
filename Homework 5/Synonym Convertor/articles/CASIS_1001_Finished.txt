Hi, My name is aaqil Ahmed and I take part in the religion and ethics of the BBC for the head of commissioning editor. I, for our part, work a lot of time to write the BBC blog you have here, in this post you can read the parts. Currently, the Muslims of Europe, the human emperor this Sunday at 3 pm, starting with BBC 2 for a new three-part documentary series.

Indeed, the Middle East today, and Europe and Islam, in order to understand the Ottoman Empire, you must understand how it developed, how it ruled, how it collapsed, and what should have followed. Presented by Raj Omar, the Ottoman Empire series in history and, upon request, most historians tell us that the same Islamic empire was? Or maybe something much more complex?

The erased history of the last Islamic empire in the world in Europe and the Middle East.
The series not only says, "Let's take a look at 50 years of history or look at the seventeenth century" - it is my belief that we could make a good series just by looking at Suleiman the Magnificent (or Suleiman the lawgiver), for example. Instead, we are focusing our series on who these people are and why their story is told in the way it is. What can we learn from the empire they created and from the state that followed? And what does he tell us about the world we live in today?
